I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the [Cryptography group](https://crypto.cs.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington, advised by Prof. [Stefano Tessaro](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~tessaro/). My research interest lies broadly in cryptography with current focus on privacy-preserving authentication, such as blind signatures and anonymous credentials. I am also interested in advanced signature schemes (such as threshold and multi-signatures) and tightness of cryptographic reductions.

Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree from Brown University, where I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Anna Lysyanskaya](https://cs.brown.edu/people/alysyans/).
During Summer 2025, I was fortunate to visit [Dennis Hofheinz](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/dhofheinz/)'s [Foundations of Cryptography](https://foc.ethz.ch/) group at ETH Zurich.


[Here](assets/pdf/CV.pdf) is my CV.
