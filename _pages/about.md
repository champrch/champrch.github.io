I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the [Cryptography group](https://crypto.cs.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington, advised by Prof. [Stefano Tessaro](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~tessaro/) and Prof. [Huijia (Rachel) Lin](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~rachel/). My research interest lies broadly in cryptography, specifically in advanced signature schemes such as blind signatures, multi-signatures, and threshold signatures. 

Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree from Brown University, where I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Anna Lysyanskaya](https://cs.brown.edu/people/alysyans/).
