I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the [Cryptography group]() at the [University of Washington](), advised by [Stefano Tessaro](). I completed my Bachelor's degree at Brown University, where I was fortunate to work with [Anna Lysyanskaya]().

My research interest lies broadly in cryptography, specifically advanced signature schemes such as blind signatures.
